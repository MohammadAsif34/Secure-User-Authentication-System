## 📋 Project Overview

Project Title: Secure Authentication System
Type: Full-Stack Web Application
Goal: To build a secure login and registration system using industry-standard authentication methods.


## ⚙️ Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token), bcrypt.js
Tools: dotenv, nodemon, Postman, Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Features

- User Registration — Secure signup with validation and hashed passwords
- User Login — JWT-based token authentication
- Password Encryption — Using bcrypt for secure password hashing
- Role-Based Access Control — Different access levels for admin and users
- Protected Routes — Middleware to verify tokens before granting access
- Session Management — Auto token expiry and refresh handling

## 🔧 Getting Started
```
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Secure-Auth-System.git
cd Secure-Auth-System

2️⃣ Setup Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

Create a .env file in the backend folder with:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

Backend will run on http://localhost:5000

3️⃣ Setup Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend will run on http://localhost:3000
